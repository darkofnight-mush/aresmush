# Aspirations

This command lets you record your character's IC goals.  Aspirations are only visible to yourself and staff, and may be changed at any time.

`aspirations` - Show you own goals.
`aspirations/set <long or short>=<goal>` - Sets an aspiration on the character.
`aspirations/fulfill <number>` - Removes an aspiration from the list and opens a job for staff to reward a beat.

Characters with the "view_bgs" permission can view aspirations using `aspirations <name>`.

Shortcuts: asp, asps
